# Sign_Language_Recognization

The Sign Language Recognition project is designed to create a system that can understand and change hand gestures from sign language into text or speech. The system uses a camera to capture hand movements and then uses computer software to recognize the signs. This helps people who use sign language talk to others who donâ€™t know it. The system can learn to identify different hand shapes, positions, and motions, turning them into written words or spoken language instantly. This technology can help deaf or hard-of-hearing people communicate and can also be used for learning or teaching sign language.
